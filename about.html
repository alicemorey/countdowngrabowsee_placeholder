            <p>🎨 We host an annual non-profit collaborative summer residency * art camp * on the grounds of Heilstätte Grabowsee, which fosters artistic collaboration through workshops, readings, performances, chance happenings, and communal living.</p>
              
            <p>🧠 We aim to cultivate a peaceful creative community, where participants are encouraged to experiment, collaborate and be inspired.</p>
      
            <p>🎛️ The project started when a collective was formed in 2012 after meeting in a basement club in Berlin, building odd installations. The first year was set as a casual event to prepare for a techno festival that did not happen. The next year we got some funding enabling the basic amenity structures to be built: kitchen, running water, compost toilet, pizza oven, treehouse... Then year after year it evolved, developing into a project unexplainable.</p>
      
            <p>🫂 Community is fundamental to everything we do. Countdown Grabowsee is a slow-growing community where kindness, tolerance and mutual support come first.</p>
      
            <p>💜 We are not corporately or privately funded; the Countdown Grabowsee project runs through the hard work, generosity and passion of everyone involved. We do not tolerate any violence or discrimination.</p>
      
            <p>🌱 We strive for an open and free environment where every human and non-human can co-exist.</p>
