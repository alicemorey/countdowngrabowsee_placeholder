              <p>📅 Countdown Grabowsee 2025 — <strong>14.8 - 24.8.25</strong></p>
        
              <p>🌿 This year under the working title <em><strong>Fairytale</strong></em>, we welcome all forms of artists, creatives, and musicians to join us for our 13th exploratory residency at Heilstätte Grabowsee.</p>
        
              <p>📖 <em> Through deep forests, over winding paths, fierce princesses and enchanted farmhands are whispering their truths into stories in your ears in our books in our history.<br>
              The supernatural gives space to the natural, we can follow in the giant’s footsteps.<br>
              Like a sculptor, fairytales are taking the edge off the plump rock that is time, that is history.<br>
              We are allowed to give sense to the world through the process of being told a fairytale — complete immersion as an anchor for reality. Though the campfire might be more significant than the fairytale itself.
              This year at Countdown Grabowsee let us collectively explore the spiritual dimension of fairytale, the utopian potential of simplicity, the power of imagination, the moral and formal economics of the storytelling practice, and the communal spirit of sitting around a campfire. </em></p>
